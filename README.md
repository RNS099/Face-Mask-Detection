# Face Mask Detection

## Description
The Face Mask Detection System is a computer vision-based project designed to identify whether a person in an image or video stream is wearing a face mask or not. This project is particularly relevant in the context of public health, as it can help enforce mask-wearing policies during pandemics or other health crises.
